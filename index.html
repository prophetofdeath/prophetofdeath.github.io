			<p><b>Role:</b> Systems Designer
			<br /><br /><b>What is it?:</b> Star Wars the Old Republic is an MMORPG set in the Star Wars universe after the previous Knights of the Old Republic games. It features rich storylines and many different ways to play.
			<br /><br /><b>My experience:</b> I began right after the release of the Legacy of the Sith expansion. Since then I have created thousands of items, led the design of several events, I've built features from concept to release, and solved many difficult challenges.
			<br /><br /><b>Favorite Contribution:</b> When I started in 2022, the game had a runaway inflation problem in the economy. I was the key leader in reigning that in. I worked with a staff economist, our engineers, and our leadership to identify the issues, developed a plan of action, and then designed features specifically to combat this issue. It was a great success, we saw the economy deflate about 90% over the next year once the new systems came online and were able to prove that it would be sustainable going forward. Tackling inflation in an MMO is a economy designers dream, and I am happy to have been able to try my hand at it with positive results.</p>

			<br /><br /><b>What is it?:</b> Ghostopia is a spooky cool role-playing game where you decorate and build up a haunted mansion for your Ghosts. It's Animal Crossing meets Runescape in a Tim Burton-esque world!
			<br /><br /><b>My experience:</b> Worked with the co-founder and creative director to synthesize her vision into game design. I produced content, designed feature specs, owned the core loop, and implemented the design for those features, as well as balanced a robust economy. Developed my own tools and workflows that were later adopted laterally across the company. Was an active force in the community, spending lots of time in game with players and using their feedback in real-time to improve the game's quality.
			<br /><br /><b>Favorite Contribution:</b> We had a very short deadline regarding an event collaboration with The Addams Family 2 movie launch, with the limited tools we had I was able to create a small event that players of all types could participate in. It was a challenge but one that felt like it paid off.</p>

I worked directly with the Principal Designer and leadership to develop pitches for various potential partnerships and explorations into the web3 space.
			<br /><br /><b>Favorite Contribution:</b> This is a bit harder to quantify, but my best contributions here were actually in terms of mentorship for these teams.

			<br /><br /><b>My experience:</b> I designed the economy and built tools to change it rapidly, including a responsive quest design system that generated quests based off of activities that could be completed in game. In this game we a/b tested EVERYTHING, including the gameplay systems like combat - we made essentially 5 versions of the same game but radically different gameplay and pitted them against eachother.
			<br /><br /><b>Favorite Contribution:</b> This was my first foray into building google sheet tools for design, and while I've learned a lot since I did the ones I built there, they were incredibly robust and made updating design a breeze.</p>

			<p><b>Role:</b> Game Designer
			<br /><br /><b>What is it?:</b> Flutterfly was a mobile game about the circle of life that was originally created for the Global Game Jam in 2011. It won the Judge's Choice Award at my location.
			<br /><br /><b>My experience:</b> This game is somewhat unique as its the only one I was the sole designer for on a team of 8. It's original design was made in 2 days of blood, sweat, and tears. Afterwards we did touch it up a bit so that we could release it into the wild, but its a good example of the early days of my design work compressed into a lightning fast deliverable. It is also the only time I have worked on a game with a procedrual design.
			<br /><br /><b>Favorite Contribution:</b> It is hard to pick one since its all very valuable to me, but I think my favorite contribution is the core concept of dying on purpose. At the time it was pretty backwards for a runner game that you wanted to hit many of the hazards.</p>
